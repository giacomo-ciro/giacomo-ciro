### Hi there 👋

🧑‍💻 I'm Giacomo, a Computer Science student aiming at a career in Machine Learning research and Software Development.

📚 I'm currently enrolled in a MSc in Artificial Intelligence at Bocconi University in Milan, Italy where I also graduated cum laude with a BSc in Economics and Computer Science.

🚀 Here I will upload and share some projects I've dealt with which I think are interesting to explore, have fun!
